Ypkpatwhay provides a command line application for planning DNA assembly projects 
using the Yeast Pathway Kit protocol. 

Typical usage at the command line could look like this::

    bjorn@bjorn-UL30A:/$ ypkpathway four_gene_xylose_pathway.txt
    
Where four_gene_xylose_pathway1.txt is a text file containing DNA sequences to be assembled
in FASTA or Genbank format. See documentation for file format.

The ypkpathway creates a subdirectory called generates a sub directory called "ypk_assembly".
This subdirectory will contain a file summary of the DNA assembly project called report.html 
which can be opened in a web browser. 

The report will include:

* The sequence of the final pathway
* Sequences of all generated intermediate vectors
* All PCR primers needed for the amplification of pathway components
* Diagnostic PCR product fragment lengths indicating correct and incorrect clonings
