==========

Ypkpatwhay provides a command line application for planning DNA assembly projects 
using the Yeast Pathway Kit protocol. 

Typical usage at the command line could look like this::

    bjorn@bjorn-UL30A:/$ ypkpathway four_gene_xylose_pathway.txt
    
Where four_gene_xylose_pathway1.txt is a text file containing DNA sequences to be assembled
in FASTA or Genbank format. See documentation for file format.

The ypkpathway creates a subdirectory called generates a sub directory called "ypk_assembly".
This subdirectory will contain a file summary of the DNA assembly project called report.html 
which can be opened in a web browser. 

The report will include:

* The sequence of the final pathway
* Sequences of all generated intermediate vectors
* All PCR primers needed for the amplification of pathway components
* Diagnostic PCR product fragment lengths indicating correct and incorrect clonings


ypkpathway depends on the `pydna <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydna/>`_ package.

The best way of installing ypkpathway is with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_::

    sudo pip install ypkpathway <enter>
    
Pip will take care of the installation of any missing dependencies.

Source
------

Make sure all dependencies are intalled. Open the pydna source code 
directory (containing the setup.py file) in terminal and type::

    sudo python setup.py install <enter>

If you need to do additional configuration, e.g. changing the base
directory, please type `python setup.py`, or see the documentation for
Setuptools.
