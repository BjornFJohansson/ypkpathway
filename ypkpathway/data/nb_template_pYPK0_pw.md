# Pathway {name}

This notebook describes the assembly of {length} single gene expression cassettes into a single pathway. 
Notebooks describing the single gene expression vectors are linked at the end of this document as are notebooks 
describing pYPKa promoter, gene and terminator vectors. Specific primers needed are also listed below.

The [pydna](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydna/) package is imported in the code cell below. 
There is a [publication](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/16/142) describing pydna as well as
[documentation](http://pydna.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) available online. 
Pydna is developed on [Github](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna).

The assembly performed here is based on content of the [INDATA_{filename}.txt](INDATA_{filename}.txt) text file.
The assembly log can be viewed [here](log.txt).

    from pydna.parsers import parse_primers
    from pydna.readers import read
    from pydna.amplify import pcr
    from pydna.assembly import Assembly

Initiate the standard primers needed to amplify each cassette.
The first cassette in the pathway is amplified with standard
primers 577 and 778, the last with
775 and 578 and all others with 775 and 778.
Standard primers are listed [here](standard_primers.txt).

    p = {{ x.id: x for x in parse_primers("standard_primers.txt") }}

The backbone vector is linearized with [EcoRV](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/EcoRV.html).

    from Bio.Restriction import EcoRV, NotI, PacI

    pYPKpw = read("pYPKpw.gb")

The cassette_products variable holds the list of expression cassette PCR products fragments to
be assembled.

    cassette_products = []

The expression cassettes comes from a series of single gene expression vectors 
held in the template_vectors list.

    cassette_vectors ='''
{cas_vectors}'''.splitlines()

    template_vectors = [read(v.strip()) for v in cassette_vectors if v.strip()]

    template_vectors

The first cassette in the pathway is amplified with standard primers 577 and 778. Suggested PCR conditions can be found at the end of this document.

    cassette_products.append( pcr( p['577'], p['778'],  template_vectors[0] ) )

Cassettes in the middle cassettes are amplified with standard primers 775 and 778. Suggested PCR conditions can be found at the end of this document.

    cassette_products.extend( pcr( p['775'], p['778'], v) for v in template_vectors[1:-1] ) 

The last cassette in the pathway is amplified with standard primers 775 and 578. Suggested PCR conditions can be found at the end of this document.

    cassette_products.append( pcr( p['775'], p['578'], template_vectors[-1] ) )

The cassettes are given names based on their order in the final construct in the code cell below.

    for i, cp in enumerate(cassette_products):
        cp.name = "Cassette {{}}".format(i+1)
        print(cp.name)

Cassettes and plasmid backbone are joined by homologous recombination in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ura3 host
which selects for the URA3 gene in pYPKpw.

    asm = Assembly( [pYPKpw.linearize(EcoRV)] + cassette_products, limit=167-47-10)
    asm

Normally, only one circular product should be formed since the 
homology limit is quite large (see cell above). More than one 
circular products might indicate an incorrect strategy. 
The largest recombination product is chosen as candidate for 
the {name} pathway.

    candidate = asm.assemble_circular()[0]

This assembly figure shows how the fragments came together.
            
    candidate.figure()

The final pathway is synchronized to the backbone vector. This means that
the plasmid origin is shifted so that it matches the original.

    pw = candidate.synced(pYPKpw)

The cseguid checksum for the resulting plasmid is calculated for future reference.
The [cseguid checksum](http://pydna.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pydna.html#pydna.utils.cseguid) 
uniquely identifies a circular double stranded sequence.

    pw.cseguid()

The file is given a name based on the sequence of expressed genes.

    pw.locus = "pw"
    pw.definition = "{name}"

Stamp sequence with cseguid checksum. This can be used to verify the 
integrity of the sequence file.

    pw.stamp()

Write sequence to a local file.

    pw.write("{name}.gb")

The pathway can be extended by digestion with either NotI or PacI or both provided that the enzymes cut once in the final pathway sequence.

    print("NotI cuts {{}} time(s) and PacI cuts {{}} time(s) in the final pathway.".format(len(pw.cut(NotI)), len(pw.cut(PacI))))
